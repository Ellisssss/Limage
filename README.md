# Limage
The "Digital Image Process" project under Linux.

Limage 2.0.1:
  This versio,I try to use matlab to achieve the 'PCA' algorithm under Windows7,
further,achieve to recognise face.Basically completed the goal.   
  While code need to be optimized,especially on the issue of variable naming.
  Because the algorithm for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors is complex,
so I use the matlab's own function.   
  Moreover,I also made the appropriate changes to the maleficent file.
